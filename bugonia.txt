DON What if someone finds out about what we’re doing?
TEDDY They won’t. No one on earth gives a single fuck about us. So until the day comes we clear the psychic cache, okay? No distractions. No gaming, no vape, no whacking it. No screens whatsoever, except for research. You promise, Don? I know this is a lot, but I want you with me on this. I need you, Don.
DON k.
TEDDY I know you’re actually smart and brave, and no one else sees it but me.
DON No, you’re No, you’re the smart one. The brains of this operation, really. Hmm. But
TEDDY Is something wrong?
DON I just I don’t think I can do this.
TEDDY Hey. Come here.
DON Hmm.
TEDDY Give me a hug.
DON Ah.
TEDDY I love you, cuzzie.
DON I love you, too, man.
TEDDY You’re my best friend in the whole world. My only friend. And I’m doing this to save you most of all. I won’t let anyone hurt you, okay? Okay?
DON Okay.
TEDDY Never.
DON Yeah.
TEDDY Medroxyprogesterone acetate. It’s a progestin-type hormonal med. Chemical castration. Okay?
DON Okay.
TEDDY In order for us to hit maximum focus, we have to clear our heads of all psychic compulsions, okay?
DON What does that mean?
TEDDY Hey, buddy. Trust me, I’ve done a shit ton of research on this. The more of that fuck filler we have jamming up our neurons, the bigger advantage it will have over us.
DON Are you sure?
TEDDY Yes, Donny, I’m sure. It’s really important, Don.
DON I just wanted to be with someone someday.
TEDDY Bud you gotta believe me. I’ve figured it out. The part of your brain that distracts you, part of your brain that makes you sad, it’s all connected to the biological imperative. These synapses firing off on procreation and seed spread and monogamy, like all these fucking pain traps. It’s all it’s all neurons, dude. You just have to harness them. Once you kill the urges, like I have, you’ll be your own master. No one can fuck with you. You’ll be totally free. Don’t you want to be free?
DON Yes.
TEDDY So you ready?
