ANDREW You’re gonna keep your health insurance and if you don’t mind me saying, there’s a lot of mental health specialists on the plan. Some of them are  
JUSTINE I um I just need to work, you know? I just need to fill my days with uh yeah I need to work.
ANDREW Justine, the scene last night was just proof that we have a lot of emotional parents here. For now I think it’s best if you keep some distance from this place until folks find time to sort themselves out. 
JUSTINE How is Alex? Is he
ANDREW Alex is doing well. He’s in Mrs. Belt’s class and we’ve been advised that the best thing that we can do for him is to keep him on a routine. Keep his life as normal as possible. 
JUSTINE I would like to speak with him. 
ANDREW We’ve had this conversation before. That’s out of the question.
JUSTINE Well I would, I would feel so much better if I could just speak with him. 
ANDREW Right there! 
JUSTINE What 
ANDREW That’s the problem. You’d feel so much better! He’s been scrutinized by the press. He’s had investigators ransack his house. He’s been traumatized. Let’s try and put Alex first, yes? 
JUSTINE If you are implying that I don’t care about Alex or the students or 
ANDREW The issue isn’t you caring or not caring. The issue here is you have a pattern in which you overstep professional lines with the students. 
JUSTINE Oh my God. Here we go. You know I do not overstep

JUSTINE Oh I hugged a crying little boy. Lock me up! 
ANDREW You know driving students home is not professional. 
JUSTINE She missed the bus! She lived close to me! What

JUSTINE It’s just we’re the only ones left.
